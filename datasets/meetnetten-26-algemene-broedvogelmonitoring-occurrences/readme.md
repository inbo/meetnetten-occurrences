*Meetnetten Algemene broedvogelmonitoring

The Flemish government wants to collect high-quality information on a number of priority plant and animal species by means of monitoring networks. These are species on which Flanders has to report to Europe in the framework of the Habitats and Birds Directives, but also other species that are important for the Flemish nature policy.

This dataset is about the monitoring of common breeding birds
