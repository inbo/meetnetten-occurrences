##Abstract
 Monitoring priority species!
 The Flemish government requires high-quality information on a number of priority plant and animal species in Flanders These are species that are protected  in the framework of the European Habitats and Birds Directives, but also other species that are important for Flemish nature policy. To provide this information the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) developed a number of long-term monitoring schemes (meetnetten.be).
 
 Each monitoring scheme consists of fixed sample locations in which target species are counted based on a standardized protocol. Data collection relies mainly on specialised volunteers and the NGO Natuurpunt Studie plays an important role in field work coordination.  Meetnetten.be is the web tool for planning and monitoring this fieldwork and for entering the field data in an accessible and efficient manner.
 Monitoring schemes for 65 priority species (within 11 different species groups) were started between 2016 and 2018. In total, these monitoring schemes consist of  more than 1,600 locations.
 This dataset is a part of the 'Meetnetten- Monitoring schemes' suite and deals with the butterfly transect data. The dataset contains count data of following priority species: Lasiommata megera, Erynnis tages, Satyrium ilicis, Phengaris alcon, Apatura iris, Hipparchia semele, Cyaniris semiargus, Hesperia comma, Pyronia tithonus, Melitaea cinxia. Additionally the dataset contains count data of other butterfly species that are not the target species of  the monitoring schemes.

Design description: Data are collected in a monitoring scheme in accordance with a strictly defined methodology. The locations to be visited are fixed. Meetnetten.be is the web tool for planning and monitoring this fieldwork and for entering the field data in an accessible and efficient manner.
 
##Taxonomic coverage
 
General taxonomic coverage description: The target butterfly species for the 'Meetnetten' project are: Lasiommata megera, Erynnis tages, Satyrium ilicis, Phengaris alcon, Apatura iris, Hipparchia semele, Cyaniris semiargus, Hesperia comma, Pyronia tithonus and Melitaea cinxia. Other butterflies observed during the sampling are also included.

##Methods
 
###Method step description:
-   	Collection of data following the field protocol
-   	Data is stored in a relational database
-   	A custom SQL view on the database was created to map the original data to DwC
-   	A database connection from IPT to the relational database was created
-   	Completion of the IPT data publication proces (mapping & metadata)
-       Data was published to GBIF
###Study extent description: 
The *Grizzled skipper* (Aardbeivlinder) can be found in only a handful of locations in Flanders. It is a kind of poor grassland, where the host plant Tormentil(Potentilla erecta) grows.
The *Wall brown* (Argusvlinder) lives in verges and grasslands. Although it is bound by general grasses, it has deteriorated considerably in recent decades.
The distribution of the Dingy skipper (Bruin dikkopje) in Flanders is limited to a handful of locations in Limburg. This little-unremarkable species prefers (calcareous) grasslands with common bird's-foot trefoil.

The *Grayling* (Heivlinder) is mainly found on dry heathland, heather-rich grasslands and dunes with open sand, sheep grass or ostrich grass.
 
Of the once more widespread, but now endangered *Mazarine blue* (Klaverblauwtje), unfortunately only one location remains to be counted. This species is bound to grasslands with sufficient Red clover, the host plant.
 
The *Silver-spotted skipper* (Kommavlinder) can be found in a limited number of dry heathland areas with well-developed heather-rich vegetation.
 
The *Gatekeeper* (Oranje zandoogje) is a common species in Flanders that occurs locally in high densities. The distribution of this species is limited to Europe and in Western Europe the Gatekeeper reaches high densities, but here and there the species declines: therefore this butterfly was selected as a Flemish priority species and is followed up.
 
The *Glanville fritillary* (Veldparelmoervlinder) can be found in barren grasslands with a sufficient number of narrow plantain. It is a beautiful, orange-brown butterfly that flutters around in the spring.
 
 
###Sampling description: 
####Sampling Protocol: 
Butterflies Transects
Grizzled skipper, Dingy skipper,  Mazarine blue, Silver-spotted skipper, and  Glanville fritillary occur in less than 30 locations in Flanders. For these species all locations are selected for monitoring and counted annually. Grayling, Wall brown, and  Gatekeeper occur in more than 30 locations. For these species a random sample of 30 locations was drawn which are counted once every three years.  
Within each selected location, transect counts are carried out. A fixed route of a maximum of 1000m is mapped out, along which the numbers of butterflies per section of 50m are counted within an imaginary cage of 5x5m around the observer. The sampling protocol may vary a little, depending on the butterfly species.
 
 
For the Grizzled skipper we ask at least 3 field visits in good butterfly weather, during the month of May. 
 
For the Wall brown, in a counting year we ask for 6 field visits in good butterfly weather, 3 in May and 3 in the period from 20 July to 20 August.
 
The Dingy skipper flies in 2 generations, in spring (May) and in high summer (20 July - 20 August) and is therefore followed up in both seasons (at least six field visits).
 
 
For the Grayling, in a counting year we ask at least 3 field visits in good butterfly weather, in the period from 20 July to 20 August.
 
The first generation of Mazarine blues flies in spring (May). The second generation can be found in high summer (10 July - 10 August). Both seasons are followed up in this monitoring network (at least three field visits per flying season). 
 
For the Silver spotted skipper, we ask at least 3 field visits in good butterfly weather, during the month of August.
 
For the Gatekeeper, in a counting year we ask at least 3 field visits in good butterfly weather, in the period from 15 July to 15 August.
 
For the Glanville fritillary, we ask at least 3 field visits in good butterfly weather, between 1 and 31 May.
 
###Quality control description: 
There is a very strict sampling protocol to follow.
